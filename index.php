		<p> Hello, my name is Dannielle Bojorquez. I was currently working as vet tech in Moab Utah when I saw the Deep
			Dive Bootcamp.  I am looking forward to learning a lot in the class</p>

		<p> I am a mom of 2 dogs who love to lay around.  They are the light of my life and I don't know what I would do
			without them. In my spare time I love to do wedding cakes for some extra money!</p>
